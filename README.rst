lizard startpages
======================

Starting page to work around having multiple sites. At the moment, it is for
Almere only.

It is installed on the ``110-ws-d03`` machine. Adjust the
``etc/startpages.apache.conf`` by hand. Note: this repository isn't private
(yet), so don't do fancy things in that apache config and don't put passwords
in there :-)
